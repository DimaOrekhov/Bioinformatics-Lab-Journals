Downloaded all the data:
	4 file with sequencing data;
	Reference genome;
	Reference transcriptome;
	Reference annotation;

Downloaded HISAT2;
Installed DESeq2 in R;

Alignment with HISAT2:

Installed gffread:
	conda install -c bioconda gffread 
Converted .gff to .gtt:
	gffread GCF_000146045.2_R64_genomic.gff -T -o genomic.gtt
Installed subread package via conda;
Ran featureCounts:
	featureCounts -g gene_name -a *gtt -o sc_all.txt *bam
Formatted the output of feature counts:
	cat sc_all.txt | cut -f 1,7-10 > simple_counts.txt
Changed the name of IMP2' gene to IMP2_1:
	sed -i "s/'/_1/" simple_counts.txt

Downloaded R scripts for the analysis;
Ran deseq2.r on all the data:
	cat simple_counts.txt | R -f RScripts/deseq2.r
Installed R 'gplots' package;
Draw heatmap:
	cat deseq_res/norm-matrix-deseq2.txt | R -f RScripts/draw-heatmap.r
It is seen from the heatmap in output.pdf that expression differ in yeasts under different conditions;
Got top 50 genes according to p-value;
Obtained GO results. 
Used pandas to determine whether a gene is down- or upregulated during fermenation based on the comparison with the base mean, scripts are present in Analyzing_results.ipynb.
Computed how many genes are significant according to different p-val thresholds.
