----Repeat masking----

    Ran RepeatMasker web version, specified "tardigrada" as a DNA source. Library contained 180 ancestral and ubiquitous sequences, 0 lineage speific. I'm not sure if this is a proper result.

    Obtained the results for RepeatMasker using C. Elegans as a library. Results are pretty much the same.

----Gene prediction----

    Couldn't build a phylogenetic tree at the web site for free. Chose melanogaster as a reference in Augustus, because it is an arthropod, which is the closest clade to the tardigrada, and has a relatively long genome. I got only 200 sequences in the output .gff file, seemed too suspicious thus I've decided to use the .gff data we were given.

----Getting protein sequences from annotation----

    Downloaded Augustus output.
    Ran perl script:
        "chmod -x getAnnoFasta.pl"
        "./getAnnoFasta.pl augustus.whole.gff"

    Counted the number of proteins obtained via:
        "grep '>' augustus.whole.aa | wc -l"

    16435 proteins have been obtained

----Determining localization based on peptides data----
    
    Made a local blast database via:
	"./makeblastdb -in ../../../Tardigrada/ScriptAltrun/augustus.whole.aa -dbtype prot -parse_seqids -out ../../../Tardigrada/P_MDB_pc/P_MDB_from_precomp"

    Used blastp to align peptide.fa file:
	"./blastp -query ../../../Tardigrada/peptides.fa -db ../../../Tardigrada/P_MDB_pc/P_MDB_from_precomp -outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid pident mismatch evalue bitscore qcovs qcovhsp' -out ../../../Tardigrada/BlastP_pc_qc"

    Written a short python script in Jupyter notebook to get a list of proteins which either have 100% coverage and 85% identity with any of the peptides or 90%coverage and 100% identity. Got the list of 22 proteins.
    Via the script in the same Jupyter notebook composed a fasta file that contains 22 proteins obtained earlier: "Pep_aligned_pc_qc".
    The notebook can be found in the repository under the name "parse_BLAST_result.ipynb".

----WoLF PSORT----
    
    Uploaded the file containing 22 proteins, set "Animal" as an organism type.
    Obtained the categories and counts, result is in the file "WoLF_pc.txt"
    The largest count is used to classify a protein by its location.
    	13 proteins calssified as Secretory;
	1 as Mitochondrial;
	1 as belonging to Endoplasmic Reticulum;
	3 as Membrane;
	4 as nuclear.

----TargetP 1.1 Server----
    
    Obtained the report from TargetP 1.1 Server.
    	14 proteins classified as Secretory;
    	1 as Mitochondrial;
	7 as belonging to other locations.
    The full result is in the     

----BLAST+ to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot----
    
    Downloaded the database from: https://www.uniprot.org/downloads
    Made a local database from a fasta file:
	"./makeblastdb -in ../../Data_Bases/uniprot_sprot.fasta -dbtype prot -parse_seqids -out ../../Data_Bases/UniProtKB_Swiss/UniProtKB_Swiss"
    Used blastp to align 20 proteins.
	"./blastp -query ../../../Tardigrada/Pep_aligned_pc_qc.fa -db ../../Data_Bases/UniProtKB_Swiss/UniProtKB_Swiss -outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid pident evalue score bitscore qcovs' -out ../../../Tardigrada/BlastPepA_pcq6"

    Obtained the top hits via Python script in the "parse_Blast_results.ipynb" notebook. Top hist was selected based on score, in cases of two proteins having identical value of score the one with smaller evalue was selected.

    Other metrics are in the spreadsheet "Top_hits.xlsx", the annotation for the proteins can be found there as well.
    Full result of the alignment containing all the hits is in the file BlastPepa_pcq6.
    Note that of 22 proteins only 20 aligned.
