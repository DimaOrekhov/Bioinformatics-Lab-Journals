This project is aimed to identify genetic changes that led to antibiotic resistance in a given E.Coli strain.

Below is the decription of the workflow:

1. Created folder Data:

    Downloaded reference genome and annotation file;
    Downloaded Illumina sequences of a resistant strain;

2. Manual inspection of sequencing files:

    Fasta files match the required format;
    Word counts via "wc -l" command:
	1823504 amp_res_1.fastq
	1823504 amp_res_2.fastq
    Number of reads = 455876 (number of lines divided by 4 lines per pead);

3. Fastqc:

    Fastqc installed manualy;
    Got two reports in html format;
    Number of reads is 455876, our previous calculations were right;
    Red circles (abnormalities):
	Per base sequence quality (both amp_res_1 and amp_res_2 files), very high variance in quality at ends of reads;
	Per tile sequence quality (only amp_res_1 file);
    Differences between amp_res_1 and amp_res_2 files:
	Per tile sequence quality (abnormal in amp_res_1 and slightly abnormal in amp_res_2);
	Non-significant spike at 6th base in N-content of reads in amp_res_1 file;
    Increased GC-content of the genome;

4. Trimming sequencing data with Trimmomatic:

    Specified Sanger-encoding "-phred33";
    The following parameters were specified:
	LEADING:20
	TRAILING:20
	SLIDINGWINDOW:10:20
	MINLEN:20
    The full command that was executed can be found in the trimm_command.sh file.
    Trimming results:
	Both Surviving: 446259 (97.89%) 
	Forward Only Surviving: 9216 (2.02%) 
	Reverse Only Surviving: 273 (0.06%) 
	Dropped: 128 (0.03%)
    Reads count via shell command:
	Number of reads in 1P and 2P files: 446259

    Fastqc analysis of trimmed reads:
	Red circle indicating abnormal per base sequence quality IS GONE;
	Slightly abnormal sequence length distribution (peak at 101bp);
	Long tail of the distribution of average per read quality is gone;

    Fastqc on reads trimmed with "SLIDINGWINDOW:10:30":
	Sequence length distribution have quite a long tail.
