This project is aimed to identify genetic changes that led to antibiotic resistance in a given E.Coli strain.

Below is the decription of the workflow:

1. Created folder Data:
    Downloaded reference genome and annotation file;
    Downloaded Illumina sequences of a resistant strain;

2. Manual inspection of sequencing files:
    Fasta files match the required format;
    Word counts via "wc -l" command:
	1823504 amp_res_1.fastq
	1823504 amp_res_2.fastq
    Number of reads = 455876 (number of lines divided by 4 lines per pead);

3. Fastqc:
    Fastqc installed manualy;
    Got two reports in html format;
    Number of reads is 455876, our previous calculations were right;
    Red circles (abnormalities):
	Per base sequence quality (both amp_res_1 and amp_res_2 files), very high variance in quality at ends of reads;
	Per tile sequence quality (only amp_res_1 file);
    Differences between amp_res_1 and amp_res_2 files:
	Per tile sequence quality (abnormal in amp_res_1 and slightly abnormal in amp_res_2);
	Non-significant spike at 6th base in N-content of reads in amp_res_1 file;
    Increased GC-content of the genome;

4. Filtering the reads with Trimmomatic:
    Choose Sanger-encoding "phred33";
