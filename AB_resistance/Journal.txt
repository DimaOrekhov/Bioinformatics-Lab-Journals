This project is aimed to identify genetic changes that led to antibiotic restance in a given E.Coli strain.

1. Created folder Data:
    Downloaded reference genome and annotation file;
    Downloaded Illumina sequences of a resistant strain;

2. Manual inspection of sequencing files:
    Fasta files match the required format;
    Word counts: 
	1823504 amp_res_1.fastq
	1823504 amp_res_2.fastq
    Number of reads = 455876 (number of lines divided by 4 lines per pead);
